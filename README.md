# Portfolio
This is made with django 2.

Note: static files are ignored in this project. You might not view images at thier apt. position.

To make use of static files, 

1. You need to place your resume and image in the portfolio/static directory.
2. You need to run: "python manage.py collectstatic"(without inverted commas) in the cmd.

Note: Better to run this project in virtual environment.
